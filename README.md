# 🌍 Climate Echoes

**Amplifying youth voices on climate justice through creative expression.**

Climate Echoes is a global storytelling platform for young people (ages 14–30) to share their emotions, challenges, and visions about the climate crisis. Through art, film, music, performance, AI-assisted works, and digital storytelling, we aim to highlight diverse perspectives on climate justice and resilience.

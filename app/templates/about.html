      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Climate Echoes is a youth-centered platform amplifying creative expressions on climate justice. We invite submissions from youth aged 14–30 globally, curating a living exhibition of stories, sounds, and visions for a just future.</p>
      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>Young people are on the frontlines of climate disruption. Art transforms complex feelings into shared action—bridging climate anxiety, honoring Indigenous wisdom, and exposing greenwashing while demanding justice.</p>
